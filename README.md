# SEB-Hardware

Uni web app project

## Development

To setup the database, execute `seed.php`. This will by default use the values below to connect to the database:

```php
$db_host = "localhost"
$db_user = "root"
$db_password = ""
$db_name = "seb_hardware"
```

Change the values accordingly where necessary. The script will not run if the database already exist.
